# QuietBond - Intimate Friendship App

Welcome to QuietBond, a React Native mobile application designed for authentic, intelligent people seeking meaningful, trust-based friendships and connections.

## Overview
QuietBond is a mobile app built with React Native and Expo, using Firebase for real-time data and authentication. It prioritizes deep emotional and intellectual connections, featuring screens like Welcome, Login, Signup, Home, Prompt, and Chat. The app de-emphasizes photos, preferring custom art and avatars to create an authentic user experience.

## Features
- **Text-First Connections**: No photos initiallyâ€”users connect through thoughtful prompts and bios, echoing MUDs and pen-pal letters.  
- **Abstract Avatars**: Customizable geometric shapes (e.g., hearts, loops) in muted blues and greens.  
- **Daily Matches**: Curated, trust-based matches based on connection style quizzes.  
- **Prompt-Driven Chats**: Mutual prompts unlock conversations, fostering slow, meaningful interactions.
- **Photo Unlock**: Photos can be unlocked once sufficient trust has been established. 
- **Watercolor Glitch Aesthetic**: Cozy, intellectual design with digital glitch effects for a modern MUD vibe.  
- **Accessibility**: High-contrast, screen-reader-compatible UI for inclusive use.
